## Chapter 2 Naming
| Name               | Reflection |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| `isPassword`       | **Use one word per concept:** This name is fairly descriptive, with the keyword "is" indicating that the method returns a boolean value. This is consistent with other method names that similarly return booleans.  |
| `mustHaveNumber`    | **Use one word per concept:** This variable name breaks the naming consistency. "isNumberRequired" would be more consistent with the method names that also use "is". The other properties on the options object in "isPassword" should be renamed in a similar fashion to maintain consistency.  |
| `hasLowerCase`     | **Use one word per concept:** This method name breaks consistency. Both "has" and "contains" convey the same meaning; therefore, only one should be used to describe the concept.  |
| `cantHaveAnyOf`     | **Avoid disinformation:** "Of" does not specify what can't be had and doesn't add anything to the name.<br><br> **Use problem domain names:** A better name would be "blacklistedCharacters", as a programmer would understand what a blacklist is, and it specifies what isn't being allowed. The "s" also suggests that it is an array.  |
| `ValidateString`   | **Class names:** This is the name of the module and the class that contains the methods. It's an appropriate name because it accurately describes the class's functionality.  |
