#Reflection

##Chapter 2 Naming
| Name    | reflection |
| -------- | -------   |
|  isPassword |  **Use one word per consept:** This name is fairly descriptive, the keyword "is" hinting that the return of the method is a boolean value and this is consitant with other method names that similarly return booleans.  |
| mustHaveNumber |   **Use one word per consept:** This variable name breaks the consistancy of using "isNumberRequired" would be more consistant with the method names that also use is and the other properties on the options object in isPassword should be renamed in a similar fashion to keep things consistant.  |
| hasLowerCase    |  **Use one word per consept:** This method name breaks the consistancy, both has and contains has the same meaning and thus only one should be used to describe the concept.  |
| cantHaveAnyOf    |  **Avoid disinformation:** Of does not specity what it is that cant be had and doesn't add anything to the name.<br><br> **Use problem domain names:**  A better name would be "blacklistedCharacters", beucase a programmer would know what a blacklist is and it also specifies what isn't being allowed. The "s" also suggests that it is an array.  |
| validateString    |  **Class names:** This is the name if the module and the class that contains the methods. Its an appropriate name beucase it correctly describes the classes functionality.  |
